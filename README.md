# flashcards

This express.js project is based on the course [Express Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/express-basics-2) 
by [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/). The app makes use of cookies, routes, redirects, error handling and
pug template files

I am currently extending this project to allow users to login with authentication, create their own flashcards, 
store them in a database, and switch between flash card sets.
